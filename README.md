# camber_curve_analysis
Camber Curve Analysis tool I built for the redesign of the suspension on my 240z. I am converting a Macpherson strut system to a SLA system

The inputs are the:
* Spindle Length [in]
* LCA Length [in]
* LCA Mounts (x, y). Origin
* LCA Sweep (lower:step:upper). [deg]
* UCA Length [in]
* UCA Mounts (x, y). 
* UCA Sweep (lower:step:upper). [deg]
